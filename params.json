I had 3 weeks to do a prototype and this is what I came up with. I won the competition so my ideas were absorbed into the official app which will be launching at some date in the future.\r\n\r\n## Future Features\r\n\r\n* More contacts\r\n* Better news feed\r\n* Update locations for new buildings\r\n* Refactor code as this was rushed for a competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nFind below some quick links to the technology used to build the application.\r\n\r\n[Android Development](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html) , [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/?hl=en) , [News Story of the Competition](http://www.uws.ac.uk/news---categories/corporate/student-creates-uws-campus-app/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
