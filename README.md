# UWS Campus App

This is a small Java based Android application I made for a university competition. The app is downloadable [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uws.campus_app).
It was made because my university hosted a competition to see who could come up with the best mobile app for directing students across the campus. I had 3 weeks to do a prototype and this is what I came up with. I won the competition so my ideas were absorbed into the official app which will be launching at some date in the future. As it so happens I use it myself so I try to keep it updated when I can.

## Future Features

* More contacts
* Better news feed
* Update locations for new buildings
* Refactor code as this was rushed for a competition.
