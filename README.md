UWS Campus App is Java based Android application I made for a university competition. It was made because my university hosted a competition to see who could come up with the best mobile app for directing students across the campus, it was built in 3 weeks. However I managed to win the competition so my ideas were absorbed into the official app which will be launching at some date in the future.

## Overview

The Android app was written in Java with the Android SDK as I had little time to do the app there was no way I could have built this app with the Android NDK. I also used the Google Map, Location and Direction APIs for tracking the individual on the campus and providing directions. Additionally a Node.js server was developed for providing news to the mobile app although at the moment this news is static. As it so happens I use the application myself so I try to keep it updated where I can and below you can find the news story for the competition run at my university.
