# UWS Campus App

This is a small Java based Android application I made for a university competition. The app is downloadable [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uws.campus_app).
It was made because my university hosted a competition to see who could come up with the best mobile app for directing students across the campus. I had 3 weeks to do a prototype. I won the competition so my ideas were absorbed into the official app which will be launching at some date in the future. As it so happens I use it myself so I try to keep it updated where I can.

## Overview

The Android app was written in Java with the Android SDK. I also use the Google Map, Location and Direction APIs for tracking the individual on the campus and providing directions. Additionally a Node.js server was developed for providing news to the mobile app although at the moment this news is static.

## Future Features

* Refactor Source Code
